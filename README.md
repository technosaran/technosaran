## About

I'm an AI/ML engineer focused on developing practical machine learning solutions and scalable software systems. My work centers on computer vision, deep learning model deployment, and building production-ready applications that solve real problems.

I approach engineering with a focus on clean architecture, maintainable code, and measurable impact. Whether it's developing CNN-based disease detection systems or algorithmic trading tools, I prioritize solutions that work reliably in production environments.

**Current Focus:**  
Deepening expertise in transformer architectures, MLOps practices, and cloud-native AI deployment while building systems that bridge the gap between research and production.

## Projects

### Smart Crop Doctor
**AI-powered agricultural disease detection system**

- **Problem:** Farmers need accessible tools for early crop disease identification to prevent yield loss
- **Solution:** Built a CNN-based classification system with explainable AI (Grad-CAM) for transparent predictions
- **Tech Stack:** PyTorch, TensorFlow, OpenCV, FastAPI, TensorFlow Lite
- **Outcome:** Production-ready system optimized for mobile deployment with automated data augmentation pipeline

### Algorithmic Trading Systems
**Automated trading with risk management**

- **Problem:** Manual trading is time-intensive and emotionally driven; need systematic approach with consistent risk control
- **Solution:** Developed MT5 Expert Advisor with pattern recognition, dynamic support/resistance detection, and ATR-based position sizing
- **Tech Stack:** MQL5, C++, MetaTrader 5
- **Outcome:** Backtested system with adaptive parameters across multiple timeframes and market conditions

### TradingView Technical Indicators
**Custom indicators for market analysis**

- **Problem:** Standard indicators often repaint or generate false signals; traders need reliable, real-time tools
- **Solution:** Created Pine Script indicators with multi-dimensional filtering and volume confirmation
- **Tech Stack:** Pine Script v5, TradingView API
- **Outcome:** Non-repainting indicators used by traders for entry filtering and market structure analysis

### Interactive 3D Portfolio
**WebGL-powered personal website**

- **Problem:** Traditional portfolios lack engagement and fail to showcase technical frontend capabilities
- **Solution:** Built interactive portfolio with Three.js particle systems and custom GLSL shaders
- **Tech Stack:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript ES6+, Three.js, WebGL, GLSL
- **Outcome:** Live at [technosaran.github.io/portfolio](https://technosaran.github.io/portfolio)
